# React Data Fetching Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React components that fetch data using the `useEffect` hook. The bug relates to incomplete error handling and improper loading state management.

## Bug Description
The `MyComponent` fetches data from `/api/data`.  The current implementation has issues with error handling and loading state updates. Under certain network conditions, the loading indicator might not disappear or error handling might be insufficient.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Start a mock API server (or simulate network errors).
4. Run `npm start`. Observe the behavior under normal conditions and simulated network errors.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates a more robust approach to data fetching, including improved error handling and loading state management.  The improved version ensures that loading is shown while data is being fetched, error messages are shown appropriately, and the loading state is correctly managed even if an error occurs.
